                        <p>A certificate of deposit (CD) is a time deposit, a financial product commonly sold in the
                            United
                            States and elsewhere by banks, thrift institutions, and credit unions.
                            CDs are similar to savings accounts in that they are insured and thus virtually risk free;
                            they
                            are "money in the bank". In the USA, CDs are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance
                            Corporation (FDIC) for banks and by the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) for
                            credit
                            unions. They are different from savings accounts in that the CD has a specific, fixed term
                            (often one, three, or six months; or one to five years) and, usually, a fixed interest rate.
                            It
                            is intended that the CD be held until maturity, at which time the money may be withdrawn
                            together with the accrued interest.</p>

                        <p>In exchange for keeping the money on deposit for the agreed-on term, institutions usually
                            grant
                            higher interest rates than they do on accounts from which money may be withdrawn on demand,
                            although this may not be the case in an inverted yield curve situation. Fixed rates are
                            common,
                            but some institutions offer CDs with various forms of variable rates. For example, in
                            mid-2004,
                            interest rates were expected to rise, many banks and credit unions began to offer CDs with a
                            "bump-up" feature. These allow for a single readjustment of the interest rate, at a time of
                            the
                            consumer's choosing, during the term of the CD. Sometimes, CDs that are indexed to the stock
                            market, the bond market, or other indices are introduced.</p>
